- reset method that takes into account obstacles
- reset manually if using obsacles? 


- Git wiki
- Examples
- Tasks

- Test cont turns

- Use Jeremy's sensor to check if about to hit an obstacle, if so stop motors, in the contForward and Reverse

- Fix reset method to take robot back to start position and rotation, not always 0,0,0
- Allow user to also set a start rotation? - reset() will need to be changed too 
- change reset to use change_rot method, to make it shorter

- Go through the intitioator method and remove stuff about pins im not using and above it in global variables



- Maybe rename some methods to more intuitive names? get_pos and get_rot to full names
