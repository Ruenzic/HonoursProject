-For now, ignore going straight



- reset method that takes into account obstacles
- reset manually if using obsacles? 


- Git wiki
- Examples
- Tasks

- Test cont turns

- Use Jeremy's sensor to check if about to hit an obstacle, if so stop motors, in the contForward and Reverse

- Fix reset method to take robot back to start position and rotation, not always 0,0,0
- Code a method that will follow a path 
- Add to reset a check that if there are obstacles, will create a path and use it rather

- When a user sets a list of obstacles, rewrite the old ones, dont just add on maybe? 
|-> Maybe make another method called reset_obstacles() and add_obstacles() instead of set_obstacles()


- Maybe rename some methods to more intuitive names? get_pos and get_rot to full names
