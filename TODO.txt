- Git wiki
- Examples
- Tasks

- Test cont turns

- Use Jeremy's sensor to check if about to hit an obstacle, if so stop motors, in the contForward and Reverse
- Also maybe stop the robot from turing after 10 seconds (check current time, and keep track)
 ### These methods will then be blocking methods and will sleep.

- Possibly just always use pathfind for reset, might be more accurate




- sleep timer for leds
- check if methods are blocking


- turn both LEDS on again/ or off in the reset()? 
- edit wiki and take out stuff about user having to call reset and cleanup
